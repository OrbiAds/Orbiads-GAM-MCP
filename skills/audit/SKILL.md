# OrbiAds GAM — Account Audits & Billing

_Perform delivery, inventory, security, and billing audits. Track credit transactions and system log histories._

**Mode:** read-only · **Tools included:** 3 · **Total actions:** 11 · **CLI coverage:** partial (3/11 actions)

Parent MCP tools: `audit`, `audit_skill`, `billing`.

## Surfaces

OrbiAds exposes the same backend through two surfaces; **MCP is the default**. A subset of actions also has a CLI command (`cli_coverage: partial` — 3/11 actions here). Per-action availability (MCP command vs `orbiads <command>` vs `MCP-only`) is listed in [`references/actions.md`](references/actions.md).

**Rule:** if an action is marked `MCP-only` in that table, fall back to the MCP surface (or the web app) for it — never improvise a raw REST call or shell around the CLI.

## CLI usage

```bash
pip install orbiads-cli
orbiads auth status --json     # verify you are authenticated first
orbiads network info --json    # confirm the active tenant / network
```

- Always pass `--json` so the agent parses structured output, never scraped text.
- **CLI gap → fall back to MCP for that action; never shell out around the CLI.**

## Safety Contract

- **Reads are free.** Every action in this skill is read-only (0 credits, no GAM mutation). Call them liberally for state discovery.
- **Never invent identifiers.** Do not guess a `tenantId` or `networkCode` — resolve them from the authenticated session first.
- **Never leak raw SOAP/REST traces** to the user — surface the structured `error` object instead.
- These rules apply identically on the MCP and CLI surfaces — a CLI write (`orbiads ... create/deploy`) needs the same preview + explicit user confirmation as an MCP write.

## Full action catalogue

Full action catalogue (costs, write flags, confirmation tokens, CLI equivalents): read [`references/actions.md`](references/actions.md).

## Routing back to the orchestrator

This sub-skill is `user-invocable: false`. The `orbiads` orchestrator ([`../orbiads/SKILL.md`](../orbiads/SKILL.md)) routes intents — and the MCP-vs-CLI surface choice — to these tools based on its routing table. If you load this file directly, you bypass the orchestrator's context intake — re-route through the orchestrator unless you already know exactly which action to call.
