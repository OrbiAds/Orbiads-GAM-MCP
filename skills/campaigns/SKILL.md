# OrbiAds GAM — Campaign Operations & Creative QA

_Orchestrate end-to-end campaigns, orders, line items, creative uploads, creative QA compliance scans, and placement bindings._

**Mode:** mixed (read + write) · **Tools included:** 12 · **Total actions:** 149 · **CLI coverage:** partial (106/149 actions)

Parent MCP tools: `ad_review_center`, `campaign`, `creative_assets`, `creative_qa`, `creative_wrapper_skill`, `creatives`, `formats`, `gam_jobs`, `jobs`, `line_items`, `live_stream`, `orders`.

## Surfaces

OrbiAds exposes the same backend through two surfaces; **MCP is the default**. A subset of actions also has a CLI command (`cli_coverage: partial` — 106/149 actions here). Per-action availability (MCP command vs `orbiads <command>` vs `MCP-only`) is listed in [`references/actions.md`](references/actions.md).

**Rule:** if an action is marked `MCP-only` in that table, fall back to the MCP surface (or the web app) for it — never improvise a raw REST call or shell around the CLI.

## CLI usage

```bash
pip install orbiads-cli
orbiads auth status --json     # verify you are authenticated first
orbiads network info --json    # confirm the active tenant / network
```

- Always pass `--json` so the agent parses structured output, never scraped text.
- **CLI gap → fall back to MCP for that action; never shell out around the CLI.**

## Safety Contract

- **Reads are free; writes cost credits.** Call reads liberally for state discovery before any mutation.
- **preview → confirm → execute.** Every write runs once with `dry_run=true` (or no `confirmation_token`) to return a preview + token + cost, then again with the same payload + `confirmation_token`. Get explicit user consent between the two calls.
- **Never bypass `billing_guard`** and never reuse a stale token — payload drift returns `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_MISMATCH`; refresh the preview.
- **Never invent identifiers.** Do not guess a `tenantId` / `networkCode` / advertiser / order id — resolve them from the session or a read first.
- **At most 2 write retries**, then stop and report.
- **Never leak raw SOAP/REST traces** to the user — surface the structured `error` object instead.
- These rules apply identically on the MCP and CLI surfaces — a CLI write (`orbiads ... create/deploy`) needs the same preview + explicit user confirmation as an MCP write.

## Routing back to the orchestrator

This sub-skill is `user-invocable: false`. The `orbiads` orchestrator ([`../orbiads/SKILL.md`](../orbiads/SKILL.md)) routes intents — and the MCP-vs-CLI surface choice — to these tools based on its routing table. If you load this file directly, you bypass the orchestrator's context intake — re-route through the orchestrator unless you already know exactly which action to call.
